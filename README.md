# tsumego-solver

A program for solving and generating tsumego puzzles, based on the paper [_Search versus Knowledge for Solving Life and Death Problems in Go_](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2005/AAAI05-218.pdf).

[Example puzzles generated by tsumego-solver](https://tsumego-solver-puzzles.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/generated_puzzles.tar.xz).

## Installation

You can download the CLI from [github releases](https://github.com/cameron-martin/tsumego-solver/releases).

## Usage

### Generating puzzles

The following command will generate puzzles and output them in sgf format to the `generated_puzzles` directory.

```sh
./cli generate
```

## Development

### Running benchmarks

```sh
cargo bench
```

### Generating asm

```sh
RUSTFLAGS="-g --emit asm -Z asm-comments" cargo build --release
```

Note the [asm-comments flag](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/53290) only works with nightly rust.
